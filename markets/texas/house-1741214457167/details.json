    "description": "rue Spring and True Autumn sit opposite each other on the seasonal flow chart. Both seasons' primary colour aspect is warm. But the distinguishing feature between them is their secondary aspect \u2013 True Spring is bright, whereas True Autumn is muted.\r\n\r\nThat means that True Autumn\u2019s appearance is toned down, and their colouring blends. There is also a lower contrast between the features compared to True Spring.\r\n\r\nTrue Spring, on the other hand, has a fresh and bright colouring. Where True Autumn features complement each other, True Spring features contrast each other. Because of their contrasting appearance, True Springs can handle a lot of colour, and they look better in contrasted colours than True Autumns do."
